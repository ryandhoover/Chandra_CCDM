Hello!

Instructions on how to run the "CCDM Biannual.py" script to generate the CCDM Biannual plots / data files.

Method One (Direct ssh via Windows or Mac terminal):
- Using windows terminal (or Mac terminal), ssh into chimchim (ssh user@131.142.113.13)
- "cd" to the following directory.
   - cd /home/rhoover/python/Biannual/
- Activate ska3flight environment
   - ska3flight
- Run "CCDM Biannual.py" script
   - python "CCDM Biannual.py"
- Follow script instructions via terminal window.

Notes:
- Script will generate new biannual directory within "\\noodle\FOT\engineering\ccdm\Current_CCDM_Files\Quarterly Report" based on your input.
- Script execution takes around 50 min (it pulls lots of data)
- Output directory populated with csv, png, and html file(s) to be used in CCDM biannual report.

Method Two (VSCode or PyCharm):
- Using VSCode or PyCharm, open an SSH session on chimchim (user@131.142.133.13)
   - I used VSCode, to use this you must install the "remote-ssh" extension.
- Open the base directory on chimchim (/)
   - Must be the base directory or VSCode cannot see both the script file and the python interperter.
- Set python interpreter for coding app
   - /proj/sot/ska3/flight/bin/python
   - Choose python3.10+
- Open terminal within coding app and activate ska3flight environment (ska3flight)
   - Must still activate ska3fligth to acess the engineering data archive.
- Open script within coding app
   - /home/rhoover/python/Biannual/"CCDM Biannual.py"
- Execute script within coding app.
    - In VSCode this is "F5" on your keyboard.
- Follow script instructions via coding app terminal window.

Notes:
- Script will generate new biannual directory within "\\noodle\FOT\engineering\ccdm\Current_CCDM_Files\Quarterly Report" based on your input.
- Script execution takes around 50 min (it pulls lots of data)
- Output directory populated with csv, png, and html file(s) to be used in CCDM biannual report.
